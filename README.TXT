What is this?
      Fidget is a "Mouse Jiggler" program. At specified intervals (in seconds) Fidget will
      reposition your mouse cursor at random points on the screen. It can also simulate
      mouse clicks if so desired.

What is its Purpose?
      To thwart activity tracking software. Some companies are rather draconian (e.g. Amazon)
      and want to maximize productiviy, even at the expense of their employees. Because of the
      draconian policies of certain companies and organizations, they force their employees to
      grind their hands to the bone, and use activity tracking software to ensure that they
      never have a moment of peace. Fidget aims to bypass that.

Features:
      [+] INTERVAL:
          Fidget will move the mouse cursor at either a FIXED length in seconds or by choosing
          a random value in a RANGE of seconds. If a user wants to fidget their mouse specifically
          once every 30 seconds, they can. However, depending on which activity tracker is being
          used, it may detect fixed lengths. Therefore, a range of seconds can be used. E.g. if
          someone wants to fidget their mouse anywhere between 15 or 35 seconds.

      [+] HOT-KEY
          Fidget comes with a hot-key feature. The hot-key is a key sequence specified by the 
          user. Once the combinations is pressed, Fidget will stop moving the mouse. By default,
          ALT+F9 is the preset hot-key, but SHIFT and CTRL can be used along with F1 through F12.

      [+] TRAY ICON
          When Fidget is running, it will be hidden in the system notification-icon tray (this
          is the bottom-right miniature icon dock on the taskbar). To show Fidget's interface,
          simply double-click on the icon.

      [+] AUTO-CLICK
          In effort to mimic more user-activity, if specified by the user, Fidget will also
          left-click after each movement is made.

      [+] CURSOR RETURN
          It is possible that the user will want the cursor to remain in the same location.
          By enabling this option, Fidget will move the cursor to a random point on the screen,
          and then immediately return the cursor to the previous position. If the AUTO-CLICK
          option is enabled, the left-click will be simulated when the cursor has returned to
          the original position.

Known issues:
      Currently there are no known issues with this program. Activity tracking software/hardware
      are getting even more advanced as technology increases. Some trackers will check the driver
      that regulates mouse function. Mice (both wired and wireless) take millions of tiny pictures
      of the surface it is laying on. Each pictures indicates a direction and where to synchronously
      move the pointer. Fidget does not emulate these pictures but simply moves the cursor, and if
      said trackers were to attempt to monitor this behavior, Fidget would fail the test. Keep
      that in mind.
